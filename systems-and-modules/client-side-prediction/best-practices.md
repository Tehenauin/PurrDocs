# Best Practices

**Use Structs for `INPUT` and `STATE`**

* Define `INPUT` and `STATE` as **structs** in C#, not classes.
* Structs are value types, which ensures predictable behavior during prediction and reconciliation.
*   Example:

    ```csharp
    public struct MyInput : IPredictedData
    {
        public float horizontal;
        public float vertical;
        public bool jump;
    }

    public struct MyState : IPredictedData<MyState>
    {
        public Vector3 position;
        public Quaternion rotation;
        public bool isJumping;
    }
    ```

**Why?**

* Structs are copied by value, making them ideal for storing snapshot data that needs to be reconciled.
* Avoids unintended side effects that can occur with reference types (classes).

***

**2. Initialize State with `GetInitialState`**

* Use the `protected override STATE GetInitialState()` method to define the default values for your `STATE` struct.
* This method is called when the entity is first created, ensuring that it starts with a valid initial state.

**Example**:

```csharp
protected override MyState GetInitialState()
{
    return new MyState
    {
        position = Vector3.zero,
        rotation = Quaternion.identity,
        isJumping = false
    };
}
```

**Why?**

* Ensures that your entity starts with a consistent and predictable state.
* Avoids undefined behavior caused by uninitialized state variables.

***

**3. Treat `STATE` as the Source of Truth**

* Any data that affects the simulation should be part of the `STATE` struct.
* Use `STATE` to store:
  * Entity position, rotation, and velocity.
  * Flags or variables that control behavior (e.g., `isJumping`, `isShooting`).
* Avoid modifying Unity components directly (e.g., `Transform.position`) without synchronizing them with the `STATE`.

**Why?**

* The `STATE` struct is reconciled by the CSP system, ensuring consistency between the client and server.
* Directly modifying Unity components can lead to desynchronization and unpredictable behavior.

***

**4. Use `GetUnityState` and `SetUnityState` for External Components**

* If your `STATE` affects Unity components (e.g., `Transform`, `Rigidbody`), use these overrides to synchronize them:
  * **`protected override void GetUnityState(ref STATE state)`**:
    * Updates the `STATE` struct with data from Unity components (e.g., reading the `Transform.position`).
  * **`protected override void SetUnityState(STATE state)`**:
    * Applies the `STATE` to Unity components (e.g., setting the `Transform.position`).

**Example**:

```csharp
protected override void GetUnityState(ref MyState state)
{
    state.position = transform.position;
    state.rotation = transform.rotation;
}

protected override void SetUnityState(MyState state)
{
    transform.position = state.position;
    transform.rotation = state.rotation;
}
```

**Why?**

* These methods ensure that Unity components are properly synchronized with the `STATE`, maintaining consistency during prediction and reconciliation.

**Note**

* Internally `GetUnityState` `gets called after Physics Pass (and therefore after every `Simulate` too).
* `SetUnityState`gets called after reconciliation.

***

**5. Make `SerializeField` Constants Only**

* Use `SerializeField` only for **constant values** that do not change during simulation (e.g., speed, prefab references).
* Avoid using `SerializeField` for variables that are part of the simulation logic (e.g., position, velocity).

**Why?**

* `SerializeField` variables are not reconciled by the CSP system, so changing them during simulation can lead to desynchronization.

***

**6. Keep Simulation Logic Deterministic**

* Ensure that all simulation logic (e.g., movement, physics) is deterministic and based on the `STATE` or `INPUT`.

**Why?**

* Deterministic logic ensures that the client and server produce the same results, even when running at different times or frame rates.
